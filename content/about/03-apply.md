The Social & Decision Analytics Division (SDAD) is seeking applications for graduate fellows and undergraduate interns for its Data Science for Public Good (DSPG) program. SDAD is a leading research group in the Biocomplexity Institute & Initiative at the University of Virginia. BII performs world-class informatics research in life sciences, social sciences, and human health by integrating theory, modeling and simulation with computational and experimental science in a transdisciplinary, team science research environment. 

SDAD combines expertise in statistics and social & behavioral sciences to develop quantitative methods and evidence-based research to inform decision-making and evaluation. The researchers at SDAD form a multidisciplinary team, with expertise in statistics, economics, computational social science, psychology, political science, policy and program evaluation, and data governance and information architecture. SDAD methods integrate statistical learning, network science, cognitive science, behavioral economics, game theory, crowdsourcing, and machine learning.

The DSPG program will run for 11 weeks (May 28 - August 9) for graduate fellows and 10 weeks (June 3 – August 9) for undergraduate interns. Fellows and interns will work in teams collaborating with postdoctoral associates and research faculty from SDAD, and project stakeholders. The research teams will combine disciplines including statistics, data science, and the social and behavioral sciences to address complex problems proposed by local, state, and federal agencies.

Undergraduate students in any discipline and graduate students (MS or PhD) with quantitative/analytical skills enrolled at any U.S. university are encouraged to apply. The positions (8+ undergraduate interns and 4+ graduate students) will be located in BII's location in Arlington, VA. 

To apply for this position, please send a CV, transcript, and cover letter detailing your relevant experience and interest in the position to dspg2019@virginia.edu. Please have three confidential letters of reference sent to this same email address.

The deadline for applications is January 31, 2019.
